# GenePrediction
Predicting human gene function from CRISPR genetic interaction screens, and developing machine learning models to predict genesâ€™ functions for the 17k genes from the 1x200 interaction profile. Withhold a subset of known gene GO term labels for validation. Using interaction matrix + GO term labels for a subset of genes as input for data.

Data will not be posted due to proffesor Chad Myers requests.
